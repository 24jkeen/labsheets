Initially Jupyter started off as the IPython project, an interactive python console, which later evolved a web based notebook (the ancestor of Jupyter Notebook). As IPython took off in the data science community, people observed that it could be useful not just for Python but also for other languages and so the concept of a [*Kernel*](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels) was born. In 2014 Jupyter was announced as a spinout of the IPython project separating the IPython features (Python execution and the IPython python module) from the language independent features such as the notebook and console.\n",
